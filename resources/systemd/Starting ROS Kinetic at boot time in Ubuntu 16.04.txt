Starting ROS Kinetic on boot in Ubuntu 16.04 
---

First of all, to start ROS (with roscore or roslaunch) the root needs to know where to look for it. Because of that one needs to add the following line to root .bashrc (type sudo su and then go to /root/.bashrc and copy the following line at the bottom of the file):

  source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

If we want to use custom packages from e.g. ~/catkin_ws workspace, we can also add:

  source /home/user/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

Additionally, if we want to keep the log files in the standard ROS_HOME folder (i.e. /home/user/.ros) it is worth adding the following line too:

  export ROS_HOME=/home/user/.ros

Next, we need to prepare a systemd service unit. It is important to know that the previous version of system manager (init/init.d/SysV init) was deprecated in favor of new systemd manager. The previous system, however, is kept due to compatibility issues (it can be confusing to see both upstart jobs and systemd units on a single machine). Let's create file called rostart.service in folder /etc/systemd/system/ 

  sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/rostart.service

Let's fill this file (use your favourite editor) with the following body:

  # This service is dedicated to run ROS during
  # the startup of the system

  [Unit]
  Description=ROS master
  Requires=dev-sensors-hokuyo_H0904847.device dev-sensors-hokuyo_H1320250.device
  Wants=network-online.target
  After=network.target network-online.target dev-sensors-hokuyo_H0904847.device dev-sensors-hokuyo_H1320250.device

  [Service]
  Type=simple
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/rostart.sh
  #ExecStop=
  Restart=on-failure

  [Install]
  WantedBy=default.target multi-user.target

This definition tells us that the service unit (named ROS master) will be called (started) after the network was setup correctly and a routable IP was given, and after two Hokuyo LRFs are found (normally the LRFs are found under /dev/ttyACMx after plugging them to the computer, which would result in dev-ttyACMx.device, but because we use use udev rules to create symlinks /dev/sensors/hokuyo_xxx, we use these as reference). The service will be restarted in case of any failures. We have to provide a path to a custom script rostart.sh which will be invoked on start (it can be any executable in general).

Next, we have to prepare our shell script and place it in proper folder. Let's do that with:

  sudo touch /usr/local/bin/rostart.sh

We have to fill the body with the script:

  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://my_ip:11311
  export ROS_HOSTNAME=my_ip
  export ROS_HOME=/home/user/.ros

  . /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.sh
  . /home/user/catkin_ws/devel/setup.sh

  roscore # or maybe: roslaunch /home/user/some_test.launch

The script sets some environment variables, sources appropriate workspaces and finally it starts ROS.

The custom script must be executable, therefore we need to provide it with appropriate priviledges:

  sudo chmod 744 /home/user/rostart.sh

The service file also needs appropriate priviledges:

  sudo chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/rostart.service

Now let's use systemctl (a command to manage systemd) to install the service:

  sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
  sudo systemctl enable rostart.service

You should see the following information:

  Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/rostart.service to /etc/systemd/system/rostart.service.
  Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/rostart.service to /etc/systemd/system/rostart.service.

To test the service before restarting computer use:

  sudo systemctl start rostart.service

You can also check the status of the service with 

  systemctl status rostart.service

That's it!
